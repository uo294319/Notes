## Preprocessing
- Increase quality = Increase effectiveness of machine learning models.
- Steps:
	1. Problem understanding
	2. Data collection
	3. Data preprocessing
	4. Model selection
	5. Model training
	6. Model evaluation and optimisation
	7. Implementation and use
### Analysis
- Different file formats
- Data types
	- Traditional (numerical or textual)
	- Multimedia (image, video or audio)
- Data volume
- Data sufficiency
### Cleaning
- Error and missing values
	- Calculate based on other data
	- Delete
- Irrelevant columns
- Relationship between values (redundancy)
### Standardization and Normalization
- **Standardization**
	- Gaussian Distribution (mean = 0 and deviation = 1)
	- $z = (x - \bar{x})/s$
- **Normalization**
	- Scale between 0 and 1. $z = (x - \min{(x)})\quad/\quad(\max{(x)} - \min{(x)})$
	- Scale between -1 and 1.$z = 2\times(x - \min{(x)})\quad/\quad(\max{(x)} - \min{(x)}) -1$

## Visualisation
- **Distribution**
	- Histogram
	- Bar chart
	- KDE 2D
- **Relation or dependency**
	- Bar chart
	- Line
	- Scatter plot (2D or 3D)
- **Trend**
	- Line
- **Other**
	- Geographical
	- Heat
