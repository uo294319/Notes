    - **Iterative and incremental**. Deliver value quickly and frequently.
    - Sprints
	    - Development team implements a set of user stories (requirements)
	    - Functional, shippable software
	    - 2-4 weeks
- **Roles**

## Product Backlog
- **Definition**
	- List of user requirements often expressed as User Stories (US) ordered by priority.
	- Reflects customer needs. It is owned and managed by the PO. 
	- Evolves over time as new requirements emerge or priorities change.
- **Contents**
	- **Description** (card format)
		- Description of the functionality in terms of the value it brings to the user.
		- Includes:
			- As a [role] I want [feature] for [value].
			- Acceptance criteria to know when it is considered complete (requirements).
			- Conversations with PO for further details.
		- Other US: Epic or technical
	- **Priority**
	- **Value and effort estimate**
		- Estimated by the development team.
		- Metrics used are usually story points or working days, but fictional may also be used.
		- Techniques like using Fibonacci numbers are used.

## Sprint Backlog
- Subset of the product backlog that will be implemented in a sprint.
- Done by the developing team at the beginning of each sprint.
- Selection is based on priority and team capabilities.
- Selected User Stories are broken down into several Sprint Tasks

## Scrum process
1. Sprint Planning Meetings (2 meetings in one day)
	1. Meeting 1. Requirements (half day)
		1. PO+Team decides WHAT is to be done assisted by the scrum master.
		2. Highest priority items are reviewed, discussed and refined.
		3. Commitment to what will be done in the sprint is made.
	2. Meeting 2. Planning (half day)
		1. Team decides HOW it is going to be done in a detailed manner.
		2. Additional information / Prototypes / testing and other
		3. Final selection of elements in the sprint backlog.
2. Sprint Execution
	1. Daily scrum (15 min - Stand-up meeting)
		1. Each member reports things done, that will be doing and impediments.
	2. Backlog grooming
		1. Process of reviewing and updating the product backlog
		2. PO collaborates with team to:
			1. Clarify requirements.
			2. Split large (epic) stories into smaller items.
			3. Add or modify estimates and priorities.
3. Closing the Sprint (2 meetings in one day)
	1. Meeting 1: Sprint Review
		1. A demo is shown to the PO and other stakeholders.
		2. Inspect the product and get feedback
	2. Meeting 2: Retrospective
		1. Team inspects and adapts the process without the PO.
		2. Think things that went well, things that did not and how to improve them.
