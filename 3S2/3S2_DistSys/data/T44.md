## IT needs
- Buy necessary hardware and hire personal for maintenance and services administration.
	- High initial costs of acquiring the hardware and equipment.
	- If needs are not correctly calculated:
		- If undersized, additional costs and time of acquiring new hardware
		- If oversized, costs of underutilised resources.
	- Costs of energy consumption, repairs, etc.
- Rent hardware and subcontract maintenance personnel.
	- If additional hardware is needed, negotiation and start-up time may be necessary.
	- If it is no longer needed, the minimum period contacted must still be paid.

## Cloud computing
### Introduction
- **Definition**
	- Provides network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
	- These can be provisiones and released quickly with minimum effort and management.
- **Properties**
	- On-demand self-service
	- Access via broadband network (location is irrelevant)
	- Measured service (pay per use)
	- Resource pool. (less custom configuration)
	- Quick elasticity (resources are procured and released in a very short time)
- **Software design (IDEAL)**
	- Isolated State (application components run separately)
	- Distributed Architecture
	- Elastic design. (horizontal scalability)
	- Automated management
	- Loose Coupling. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts.
- **Advantages**
	- No entry costs.
	- Automatic, fast resource provisioning based on load.
	- Optimized costs. Pay for what you use.
### Types of load
- **Stable or static load**. Constant or with minimum variations.
- **Periodic load**. Peaks at regular intervals (very common)
- **Once in a lifetime load**. Large spike that is no longer repeated (global events)
- **Unpredictable load**. Irregular interval peaks.
- **Gradual load**. Grows (or declines) at a constant rate.
### Service models
- **Application layers**
	- Physical hardware
	- Virtual Machine
	- Operating System
	- Containers
	- Runtime environment and developer tools
	- Middleware
	- Application
- **Service models**
	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		- Provides the user a virtual machine.
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		- Provide the user a runtime environment.
	- Software as a Service (SaaS)
		- Provide the user a software (application)
### Deployment models
- **Public cloud**. External providerâ€™s infrastructure.
- **Private cloud**. Own infrastructure.
- **Community cloud**. Infrastructure shared by a set of companies that collaborate.
- **Hybrid**.

## Service Catalog
- Main providers
	- Amazon AWS
	- Google Cloud Platform
	- Microsoft Azure
### Computing Services
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Pay for features an time of use.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS). Pay for resource usage.
- Functions as a Service (FaaS). Pay by number of executions, execution time and size.
- Containers as a Service (CaaS). Pay for the IaaS needed to execute it.
- Batch. Pay for resources used.
### Storage Services
- Virtual machine disks
- Block storage (blocks of bytes)
- Object storage (blobs or buckets are blocks of bytes with a name)
- Archiving systems (backups)
- File-sharing file systems ()"mounted" on several machines at once)
### Databases as Service
- Relational DB
- Non-relational DB
	- Document DB
	- Key-value stores
	- Caches (data in RAM) (typically key-value stores)
### Other services
- Virtual networks.
- Middleware.
- Monitoring, logging and alarming services.
- Deployments Automation.
- Multi-container orchestration
- PaaS for Analytics
- PaaS for IoT
