## User Interface Definition

- The User Interface (UI) is the part of a software application responsible for communicating with the user.
- We will assume that this user is always a human (not other software).

## Types of User Interfaces

	- User introduces the commands to be executed.
	- Example: Linux Shell, Windows Powershell.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
	- User interacts with images that represent real elements.
	- Example: Windows, Mac OS X

- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**
