## Web Standard Definition

## History 

1. **Origins - HTML (1991)**
	- Hiper-Text Markup Language was created.
	- It is a tag based language.
	- It mixed structure, information and style of the web.
	- This led to incompatibilities and accessibility problems.
2. **Separation - CSS (1996)**
	- Made code separation possible.
	- Today this separation is mandatory.
	- HTML presentation tags were maintained for backwards compatibility.

## Todays Structure

- Web content: **HTML 5**
- Web presentation: **CSS 3**
- Web intractability: **JavaScript**
