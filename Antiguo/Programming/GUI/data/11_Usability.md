[Back to index](../README.md)

## Definition

- Usability is how well users can use the systemâ€™s functionality.
- Usability is about creating effective user interfaces
- There are 5 dimensions (LESEL):
	- Learnability
	- Efficiency
	- Safety
	- Ergonomics
	- Look & Feel

## Learnability

- Measures how easy is for an user to learn.
- A quantity measure is how long does it take to become an expert.
- Good practices:
	1. Use widespread metaphors and names.
	2. Actions must be immediately visible, incremental and reversible.

## Efficiency

- Measures how fast it is to use once learned.
- A quantity measure is how many task an expert can perform per time.
	- We may also want to measure the ease to remember.
- Good practices:
	1. Define keyboard shortcuts or accelerators (easy memorable key combinations that usually trigger the effect in the menu-bar or a button).
	2. Use visible buttons/icons (and reveal not visible ones through a single action)
	3. Avoid asking the user unnecessary questions.
	4. Anticipating user actions.

## Safety

- Measures if there are few and recoverable errors.
- Good practices:
	1. Allow learning by doing and trying things out.
	2. Make error consequences less severe.
## Ergonomics

- Confort and fatigue
- Good practices:
	1. Make actions easy to perform (use alternative ways of interaction).
	2. Create images/elements that clearly identify the action.
	3. Give easy to follow instructions to the user on how to continue.
	4. Use neutral combinations of colors for most visible parts.
## Look & Feel

- Feelings caused by the interface
- Try to make user feel satisfied, happy and pleased.
- User experience design (UX) which focuses on experience rather than visuals (UI design).
