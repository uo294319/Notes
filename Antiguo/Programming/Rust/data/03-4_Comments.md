- A comment is a piece of text in the code that the compiler will ignore.
- They are defined by `//`.
- Everything in the line after the `//` will be ignored

```Rust
// This is a comment

// + ------------------------- +
// |  This is a prety comment  |
// + ------------------------- +

let x = 4 // This is also a comment
```
