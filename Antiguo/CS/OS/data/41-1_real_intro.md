[Back to index](../README.md)

---
## Goals
- Efficient management.
- Processes transparency.
- Unlink processes and physical location.
- Protect against forbidden accesses.
- Allow memory sharing.

## Concepts
- Main memory (MM) is accessed through addresses.
- Every running process has some part of it in the MM.
- The memory manager is the part of the OS that:
	- Allocates space in MM.
	- Locates free and used space.
	- Maximizes memory use.
